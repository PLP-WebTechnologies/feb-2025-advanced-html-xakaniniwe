    <h2>About</h2>
    <P>This website is a passion project born from the lived experience of Niniwe Xaka, a 36-year-old plus-size woman who understands<br>
       the challenges and triumphs of navigating a world that often overlooks the beauty and strength of larger bodies. Niniwe, like ><br>
       many plus-size women, has faced bullying and societal pressures throughout her life. But instead of letting these experiences <br>
       define her, she chose to embark on a journey of self-love and acceptance.<strong>"We're not here for long," Niniwe believes, </strong><br>
       and we shouldn't spend most of our time hating ourselves. We should strive for a good quality of life and be able to do things we<br>
       love with our loved ones."</P>
    <P> More on Niniwe her passion for plussize wellness</P>

         <h3>Why Plus-Size Wellness Matters</h3>

         <P>For too long, the wellness industry has focused on a narrow definition of health, often exluding and shaming plus-size individuals.<br>
         Thiswebsite exists to challenge that narrative and create a space where plus-size women can prioritize their well-being without judgment.<br>
         Majority of plus-size women are depressed because of weight. This highlights the crucial role that mental and emotional well-being plays in <br>
         overall wellness.</p>
           
         
         <h4>Plus-size wellness is about:</h4>

         <ul>
            <Li> Reclaiming Our Narratives: It's about taking control of our stories and defining our own paths to health and happiness.</Li>
            <li> Building Community: It's about creating a supportive network where we can share our experiences, find encouragement, and celebrate our<br>
             successes.</li>
            <li>Prioritizing Mental Health: It's about addressing the emotional toll of weight stigma and fostering self-compassion.</li>
            <li>Promoting Sustainable Health: It's about making lifestyle choices that are enjoyable and maintainable in the long term, not about<br>
            quick fixes or restrictive diets.</li>
            <li>Living Fully: It's about having the energy and vitality to pursue our passions and enjoy life to the fullest.</li>
            </ul>
